      <h2>Present Day: 20th October</h2>
      <p>I woke to Rishi's voice, piercing through my foggy consciousness like an alarm I couldn't turn off.  
      "Bhai, uth... It's 8:30. Late ho raha hai yrr!?" His annoyance was transparent as he slammed the bathroom door. But here’s the twist: I’m dead. Been dead for a week. But Rishi? He doesn't care. He’s still trying to wake me every day as if nothing’s changed.</p>
      <p>Who am I? Oh, right—it’s me, your least interacted-with classmate. The quiet kid, the weird one, the "psychopath" with insecurities that could fill a diary no one would bother to read. Am I happy? Well, yes and no. On the surface, everything seemed fine. I had parents who cared, siblings who loved me, and friends who thought they were invincible. But none of that mattered in the end. Not now.</p>
      <p>I died a week ago, and no one seems to have noticed. Except Rishi. He’s not waking me up for college today. No, he wants me to finish what he started.</p>
      <p>Let’s rewind back to where this all began—a week ago, in the mysterious, fog-wrapped woods just outside London. I was on a trip with my friends: Sam, William, Wayne, Rishi, and me. They thought it’d be fun to head to the outskirts and do some stupid teenage stuff. Their genius idea? Drop me in the middle of the road while I was asleep in the back of the car. You know, scare me, record it, post it online for some cheap laughs. Hilarious, right?</p>
      <p>Except what they recorded wasn’t what they expected. An old woman dragged me into the forest, letting my blood flow to my corpse, which was nothing but some flesh on a skeleton. Yeah, you read that right. She looked ancient like she crawled out from the roots of those cursed trees. They didn’t come looking for me until the next morning, and I was already gone by then. What happened in the woods that night? They didn’t know. Not then. But they’d soon find out.</p>

      <h2>Day 2: 15th October - Sam's Shower</h2>
      <p>Sam was the first to die. He wasn’t usually the loud, cocky type, but after he found out about my death, something inside him broke. We were in the cabin, the smell of damp earth and pine needles seeping through the cracked window. Sam had been in shock since the morning, repeating to himself that I couldn’t be gone, trying to drown the horror in the boiling water of the shower.</p>
      <p>The water beat down on his back, mixing with the tears he couldn’t stop. The image of me—still, lifeless—clung to him like a shadow. He squeezed his eyes shut, the shower's steady stream his only comfort, the only sound filling the empty cabin.</p>
      <p>He didn’t hear the door creak open.</p>
      <p>Rishi stepped into the bathroom, slow and deliberate. The door clicked shut with certainty, the kind of sound you only notice when it’s too late. Sam wiped the fogged mirror with his hand and froze. Rishi was there, standing behind him.</p>
      <p>"Rishi?" Sam’s voice was barely a whisper. His heart thudded, blood roaring in his ears. “What’s going on?”</p>
      <p>Rishi didn’t reply. He just stared, his eyes empty, his chest rising and falling too slowly, like a predator savoring the kill. His hand gripped the kitchen knife so tightly his knuckles whitened, the blade catching the dull light from the bathroom’s single bulb.</p>
      <p>Sam turned fully now, droplets of water clinging to his skin. “Rishi…?”</p>
      <p>Still nothing. Just the steady drip of water hitting the tile. Sam’s stomach twisted. Something was wrong—so wrong.</p>
      <p>The knife flashed in Rishi’s hand, slicing through the humid air with brutal precision. Sam gasped, a sharp pain exploding in his gut. He staggered back, his hand instinctively covering the wound, but the knife came again—faster, harder. His scream caught in his throat, drowned by the pounding water.</p>
      <p>Blood splattered the white tiles, mixing with the water in thin red rivulets that circled the drain. Sam’s legs buckled, his body sliding down the slick shower wall. His fingers reached out, grasping at nothing, his breath coming in ragged gasps.</p>
      <p>Rishi didn’t stop. He drove the knife into Sam again, the wet sound of metal tearing flesh filling the small space. Sam’s body jerked with every blow, his eyes wide with terror, then slowly dulling, glazing over. His last breath escaped in a quiet, desperate gurgle, lost beneath the steady hiss of the shower.</p>

      <h2>Day 4: 17th October - William and the Mountain Woman</h2>
      <p>Now it was William’s turn. The womanizer of the group, he wandered into the woods, seeking solace in his familiar escape—drinking and flirting. After Sam’s death, he craved distraction, and that’s when he met her: a woman wild and untamed, just like the forest that surrounded them.</p>
      <p>They never exchanged names; they didn’t need to. Lost in their own intoxicated world, laughter bubbled up between them, echoing through the trees like ghostly whispers. Rishi trailed behind, concealed in the shadows, his presence a dark cloud hovering over their fun and lust.</p>
      <p>As Williams laughed, unaware of the danger, the woman began to drift away, her figure blending seamlessly with the underbrush. It was as if she were part of the forest itself—familiar with its secrets, sensing the jeopardy that loomed nearby.</p>
      <p>Rishi stepped out from the darkness, a dark shadow towering over William, who was too drunk to notice. The forest fell silent, the air thick with anticipation. With a swift motion, Rishi seized him by the throat, slamming his head against an edged rock. Once. Twice. Each impact echoed like thunder, blood seeping from the wounds, pooling on the ground like dark promises of death.</p>

      <h2>Day 5: 18th October - Wayne's Letter</h2>
      <p>Wayne had always been different. The moment Sam died; he sensed something was terribly wrong. And when Williams disappeared, it made his unease grow stronger. He knew Rishi wasn’t the same. There was something dark in his eyes now, something twisted.</p>
      <p>By the fifth night, Wayne couldn’t take it anymore. He sat at the old wooden table in the cabin, the candlelight flickering as he penned a letter to his family—a confession. He blamed himself for my death, for leaving me behind when the old woman dragged me away, too afraid to help. Guilt crunched inside him.</p>
      <p>The cabin creaked as if it were alive, the floorboards groaning in protest. Then—click. The door closed softly, finally, like the jaws of a trap.</p>
      <p>Wayne froze, breath shallow, his heart hammering in his chest. Slowly, he turned, his eyes directed to the darkened corners of the room, to the places where shadows shouldn’t move but did.</p>
      <p>Before Wayne could react, Rishi stepped out from the dark, his eyes cold, his clothes stained with the blood of their friends. Without a word, he lunged forward, grabbing Wayne’s knife and driving it deep into his chest. Wayne gasped, his body jerking violently, but Rishi didn’t stop. He stabbed again, and again, the sound of tearing flesh filling the cabin.</p>

      <h2>Present Day: 20th October</h2>
      <p>Which brings us to today. The present. Rishi splashes cold water on my face again, yelling for me to wake up.  
        “Bhai, uth! It’s time. Only one left.”  </p>
      <p>Only one left!!!</p>
      <p>You see, Rishi never stopped talking to me after my death. To him, I’m still here, his partner in this madness. He thinks I’m helping him finish what we started.  
        And today, we have one more job to do, don’t we? He wants me to help him kill the last one. </p>
      <p>You.</p>
      <p>Yes, you. You’re reading this, aren’t you? You think you’re safe, hidden away, with no connection to what happened in the woods. But if you’re reading this, he already knows where you are.  
        You think this is just a story, but Rishi is real. And so am I. We’re coming for you next. So, when you hear a knock on your window tonight or see a shadow move outside your door... don’t panic.</p>
      <p>Just remember: Rishi never stops.</p>
      <p>And neither do I !_!</p>
